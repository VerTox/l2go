## Packet Protocol Notes

- Packet opcodes verified against Java L2J reference (`l2jserver/`)
- Multi-packet (0xD0) uses 2-byte sub-opcodes
- UserInfo/CharInfo/NpcInfo structures match Java L2J byte-for-byte
- Use `pkg/l2pkt` Writer/Reader for all new packets

### Key Packet Pitfalls (lessons learned)
- SP field in UserInfo must be WriteD (4 bytes), NOT WriteQ (8 bytes) — causes alignment shift
- NpcInfo has exactly 8 speed fields, not 10
- NPC instances must have IsRunning=true for proper idle animation
- CharSelected packet structure differs significantly from UserInfo — verify against Java L2J
- StatusUpdate opcode is 0x18, NOT 0x0E — wrong opcode causes client freeze
- NPC interaction requires MoveToPawn (0x72) before NpcHtmlMessage — without it client blocks movement
- StatusUpdate uses WriteD (32-bit) for values — EXP (int64) gets truncated. Use UserInfo (WriteQ) for EXP updates
- MoveBackwardToLocation must NOT cancel auto-attack — client sends movement to approach target for melee
- CharInfo `InCombat` field must be read from PlayerWorldState, not hardcoded to 0

## NPC System

- Templates loaded from L2J XML datapack (`references/data/stats/npcs/`)
- Spawns from PostgreSQL (migration 006), auto-seeded from `references/data/spawnlist.sql` (~38K entries)
- Dynamic visibility: KnownNPCs per player, NpcInfo on enter range, DeleteObject on leave (2500 units)
- ObjectID for NPC instances starts at 1,000,000 (atomic counter)

## Current TODOs

**Phase 8 — NPC Interaction & Combat:**
1. ~~NPC dialogue system (NpcHtmlMessage packets, HTML windows)~~ DONE
2. Trading with NPC merchants
3. Gatekeeper teleportation
4. ~~Basic attack mechanics (click-to-attack, damage calculation)~~ DONE
5. ~~HP management, death/respawn~~ DONE
6. NPC AI (aggro, patrol, return-to-spawn)

**Phase 9+ — Future:**
- Full ExBasicActionList (189 actions, currently only Walk/Run)
- Skill system (casting, effects, cooldowns)
- Quest system
- Party system
- PvP

## Combat System

- **Game loop** (`gameloop/`) owns all mutable NPC state and combat logic in a single goroutine
- **Auto-attack**: `CmdAttackRequest` sets ATTACK intention → server-side move-to-target (tick interpolates position) → `NextAttackEvent` combat-heartbeat checks reach against the server position → `HitEvent` (damage at mid-swing) → next swing cycle
- **Approach**: out-of-reach `NextAttackEvent`/`InteractApproachEvent` restart server-side movement (`startMoveToTarget`) and re-check on the next heartbeat (~400ms); the server position (not stale client packets) drives arrival. A ground move cancels the intention (stops chasing).
- **Movement does NOT cancel attack**: `MoveBackwardToLocation` no longer sends `CmdCancelAttack` — the client sends movement packets to approach the target for melee
- **EXP/SP rewards**: Proportional distribution via hate list, level penalty for large level gaps, server rate multipliers. Uses UserInfo (64-bit) instead of StatusUpdate (32-bit truncation) for EXP updates
- **Combat stance**: `PlayerWorldState.InCombat` flag propagated to CharInfo/UserInfo packets. 15s timeout after last attack via `CombatStanceTimeoutEvent`
- **Logout in combat**: Blocked with SystemMessage(1116) + ActionFailed. Allowed after combat stance expires
- **NPC retaliation**: NPCs auto-attack back when hit (via hate list)
- **Death/respawn**: Die packet → corpse decay (7s) → respawn (60s) with new ObjectID

## Character Persistence

- **Sole writer**: the game loop mutates `player.Character` progress (EXP/SP/level/HP) **without a lock**. Never read those fields from another goroutine — snapshot instead.
- **Async saver** (`service.go run()`): a goroutine drains `saveCh chan models.Character` and calls `charRepo.Update`. The loop enqueues **value-copy** snapshots (`PlayerWorldState.SnapshotCharacter`) so DB latency never stalls the tick and the write can't race the loop.
- **Autosave**: every 5 min the loop snapshots all online players to `saveCh` (timer inside `tick`, like region cleanup).
- **Level-up**: persisted immediately (`experience.go`, in the level-up branch).
- **Save-on-shutdown**: after `eg.Wait()` (loop stopped → progress stable) the saver is flushed, then `saveOnlinePlayersOnShutdown` writes the freshest snapshot under the registry lock, **then** the DB closes. Order matters: flush old queued copies before the authoritative shutdown save so a stale copy can't overwrite it.
- **Position**: `movement.UpdatePosition` writes **only** the in-memory registry (no per-move DB write — it fires on every move start/stop and ~1-2s standing ValidatePosition). Position reaches the DB via the same unified persist (autosave/shutdown/logout), baked into each snapshot from `PlayerWorldState.Position`. On crash, position is ≤5 min stale (same tolerance as EXP/HP).

## Known Limitations

- Movement speed computed per-character (base×DEX from race/class); item/buff modifiers are a no-op hook (`applyMoveSpeedBonus`) pending item-stats/skill systems
- Item type classification approximate (no full item template DB yet)
- Multi-packet handler covers only a few sub-opcodes of 50+
- No collision detection
